*I will be updating this article as I adopt new practices that help me*

# Organizational Tools
* Todoist
  * I use this app for my day to day todo list. 
  * I have it integrated with my Google Calendar so anything I add to it will automatically get added to my calendar. 
  * It's honestly been the best source of truth for my day to day tasks. Highly recommend! 
* Google Calender
  * I mean...I think everyone knows why this is important...I would recommend integrating any/all apps you can to your calendar. 

# Principles I've adopted
* Only touch a piece of paper once
  * I learned this while I was a teacher (thanks Principal Camacho!). She taught me that when a piece of paper comes across my desk to fill it out, sign it, grade it, whatever the actions were...do them and do them right the; otherwise it becomes a pile, that pile becomes unwieldy and that is a horrible thing to have around. I recommend responding to texts, emails, slack messages, and all other things immedaitely or setting reminders immediately. Whatever the immediate task is...do it...do it now and move on to the next item. 
* Take notes in meetings
  * I do this, because listening is a skill I want to improve on constantly. 
  * Taking notes helps me to stay active during a meeting or conversation and helps me focus. For others it can be a distraction, so I don't recommend this one too often. 
* Google for best practices
  * When I'm tasked with a project that is new...one where I have little experience, instead of sitting and trying to find a good starting place, I like to see if there are best practices. Those are great skeletons for projects. Highly recommend trying this.
