# Brief Intro
I shadowed Wayne Haber, the Director of Development at Gitlab, for one week. My motivation for doing this was my interest in management. 
I want to share what I experienced and learned.

Here is the program page: [https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/shadow/director-shadow-program.html](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/shadow/director-shadow-program.html)


<h1>Experience in the Program</h1>
* **Before the Program**
  * I emailed Wayne Haber at Gitlab introducing myself and expressing my interest in the Shadow program he runs at Gitlab. 
  * We had a Zoom call to discuss the program, get my questions answered, go over expectations and set a date.
  * I made an MR (adding my name to the list of participants) and submitted a MR (Merge Request). [Here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/112982) is mine. 
  * Sign NDA with Gitlab
  * Wayne will then invite you to all of the meetings possible for that week, this includes 1 on 1s with his direct reports, team meetings, Gitlab streams, menotring calls and coffee chats. 
  * Wayne will invite you to the Gitlab Slack Channel for the Shadow Program. 
* **Program Overview**
  * Sitting in during meetings
    * What was Wayne focusing on in 1 on 1s with Managers?
    * What was Wayne contributing to team meetings, as a leader? 
    * What are the primary skills that Wayne uses during his week, to do his job well?
  * Merge Requests
    * Ocassionally I was asked to to participate in Merge Request comments that Wayne was reviewing or submitting
* **What I Learned**
  * Be organized...I now use [todoist](https://todoist.com)
  * Learn to say "No" to tasks that are not high priority
  * Focus on adding value and aligning personal goals with management goals, this includes primary manager, skip level manager and higher leadership teams. 
  * Manage meeting time well...Wayne was excellent at this. 
  * Ask questions, let people express their thoughts and don't interrupt
